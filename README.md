# Davide Gena | Portfolio

This [portfolio](https://davidg33k.github.io/) is my crazy little lab where you can find the completed projects and crazy drafts of what I would like to accomplish. Have fun ;)

## How to run in local:

1. Download and install [Node.js v16.20.2](https://nodejs.org/en/download);
2. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@11.1.2`;
3. Run `npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular` or `npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular`;
4. `ng serve` to start a local server and `ng build` to build the final project.
